...and more, **without having to rewrite your app!**

* Use your current installer *(no requirement to use MSIX, but there are [reliability/security benefits to using MSIX](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/msix/overview#key-features)!)*
* Additive platform APIs *(only add what you need, leave the rest of your app as-is)*
* Works with Win32, WPF, WinForms, and more apps

Plus, **create beautiful, modern apps for Windows 11 that are backwards compatible** to Windows 10 October 2018 Update (build 17763 / version 1809)!


### Use it now!

1.2 is [available today](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/) and includes the ability to create widgets for Win11 devices, media playback controls, native Arm64 development with .NET 7 and VS2022 17.4 and much more!

### Version support

The Windows App SDK aims to work on supported versions of Windows.
Right now we support down to build 17763 (version 1809/October 2018 Update) of Windows 10.
Wherever possible, we'll use techniques like '_polyfills_'
and custom implementations to do the
heavy lifting for you and make sure your app works across Windows versions and devices.
In the future, there may be a couple APIs that are dependent on new OS features
(like new Action Center functionality),
however we will do our best to ensure
this is the exception and not the norm, and provide reasonable fallbacks when possible.
